### Create an executable
With the executable, the start of the program is slower :(

If you want to create an executable, you need to have `PyInstaller` installed

If you have `pip` in your path :
```
pip install pyinstaller
```
or
```
PATH_TO_PIP install pyinstaller
```
Then you need to execute `pyinstaller` :

If you have `pyinstaller` in your path
```
pyinstaller .\main.spec
```
or
```
py -m PyInstaller .\main.spec in the folder
```
